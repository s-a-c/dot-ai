# Workflows Index

## 1. Introduction

This section contains comprehensive workflow guidelines and processes for development, documentation, and project management. These workflows ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across all project activities.

## 2. Core Workflow Principle

**All workflows should be clear, systematic, and suitable for junior developers to understand, follow, and execute effectively.**

## 3. Workflow Structure

### 3.1. [AI-Assisted Development Workflows](010-workflows.md)
Comprehensive workflows for AI-assisted development, from feature conception to implementation and version control.

### 3.2. [Workflow Guidelines](020-workflow-guidelines.md)
Detailed Git workflow standards, terminal management, and development processes for consistent team collaboration.

### 3.3. [Product Requirements Document Workflow](030-prd-workflow.md)
Structured process for creating and managing Product Requirements Documents with AI assistance.

### 3.4. [Task Generation Workflow](040-task-generation.md)
Systematic approach to breaking down requirements into actionable hierarchical task lists.

### 3.5. [Task Processing Workflow](050-task-processing.md)
Step-by-step process for implementing features through sequential task execution with user verification.

### 3.6. [Development Workflow](060-development-workflow.md)
Comprehensive development processes, code review standards, and quality gates for maintaining PHPStan Level 10 compliance throughout the development lifecycle.
